MobileForm is an extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), providing simple form for any workflows, suitable for use on mobile phones.

## How to Use

MobileForm can only be used with the new menu layout. Ensure that the "Use new menu and workflow management." setting is set to either 'Top' or 'Bottom'.

   - You can change the title of a group by right-clicking it, clicking "Edit Group", then "Title".
2. Inside the group, put nodes you want to add to the form.
3. Save the workflow and refresh the page. Click the sidebar button with mobile phone icon to see the form.
